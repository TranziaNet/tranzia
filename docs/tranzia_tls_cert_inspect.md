## tranzia tls cert inspect

Inspect and print details of a certificate file.

### Synopsis

The 'cert inspect' command reads an X.509 certificate (PEM or DER format) and prints detailed information including:
- Subject and Issuer
- Validity period
- Serial number
- Public key algorithm and key size
- Extensions (e.g., SANs, Key Usage, Extended Key Usage)
- Whether it is a CA certificate

This is useful for debugging, verifying certificate contents, and understanding certificate chains. You can use this command for both leaf and intermediate/CA certificates.

Supports local file input or stdin.


```
